# APCSACodeALife
An application created for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course on June 2, 2023. 

Description:
Code A Life allows users to learn more about themselves through simple prompts, which is important when interacting with others because 
individuals are not usually prepared for basic questions regarding their interests. There are a total of four screens used: a login screen, 
two screens with inquiries, and a logout screen; the application will ask the player for their login details, then move them to a new screen 
where they will start answering questions. Given that the program is straightforward, every screen contains at least one text area and a few 
icons so that the user can respond to some kind of prompt and does not feel as though they simply read monotonous text. When a player is required 
to respond to a scenario in which they may have never truly been able to pick between two choices, loops are used, alongside conditionals, to 
provide them options for responding.  In order to prevent glitching and stop anyone from changing any text they are not supposed to, the 
application employs conditional statements and warnings, making sure the user enters the right data when prompted.

Playing:
Sign into the app by using a “Username” and “Password,” and then click the “Login” button
    - Input will be checked to ensure that it matches the text under the “Login” button
Refer to the “Welcome” text, and then click the “Start” button  
		- “Click Start [now]” text areas will output the choices a player can pick from
Enter a response in the “Type [in] here” text area for every prompt using the options provided
		- Answers that are not displayed on the “Click Start [now]” text areas are invalid
Click the “Next” button to continue the game
		- “Try Again” will be printed if the responses are unacceptable 
Read the “Continue playing” text, and then respond to every prompt using the suggestions
		- Any answer is valid, not just those shown towards the right of the screen
Select the “Next” button to reach the “Logout” screen
		- There is no way of returning to any of the previous screens 
Look at the “Thank you” text, and then rate the app using the “Rating Bar”
		- “Logout” button will end the game, and the player will be returned to the “Login” screen
    
Special features:
Players must meet the requirements displayed in the “Login” screen
		- A large amount of the most popular apps like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram require their users to verify their identity
		- Code A Life attempts to recreate this security feature through a much simpler system, using 1 valid “Username” and “Password” 
Only certain answers will allow users to move onto “Screen 2”
		- “Some players input responses that do not seem to answer the prompts, thus they are required to genuinely think about their choices 
Users can rate the app based on their personal likes and dislikes 
		- Experienced programmers want to hear about the experiences players had with their programs to improve them 
    - There are countless changes that can be made to Code A Life, which can be enacted if users do not enjoy playing the game
